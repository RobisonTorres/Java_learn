// The 'public' modifier allows this class to be accessed from other classes.
public class MyClass {
    // 'main' method: Java starts executing the program from this method.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... your code goes here
    }

/*
Class Declaration: The public keyword specifies that the class is accessible
from anywhere in the program, promoting a modular and interactive coding environment.

The main Method: This is where the program's execution commences. It must be
public to be universally invokable, static to be callable without instantiating
the class, and void to indicate it doesn't return any value.

The String[] args parameter serves as a container for any command-line arguments
that may be passed to the program.

File Name: The name of the source file should precisely match the class name
(MyClass in this case) and should have the .java extension (hence MyClass.java),
which is essential for the Java compiler to recognize and compile the class correctly.
